# Nekonull's DSAA

Codes are in each folder, arranged by lab number. The naming format is `lab` + `lab_number` + `problem_number` + `version` + `[fast]`

Notes are in `notes` folder.

All problems are solved in Java.

Problem website: http://acm.sustc.edu.cn/onlinejudge/contest.php (Choose (autumn) ones.)



## Versions?

There might be several versions of code to the same problem. Usually this is because there are several failed attempts before, and I have to start again or make incremental changes. The file with the highest version number should work.

## Fast?

Since OJ's time limit is quite strict, and Java's default I/O is too slow for that, I used fast read and write to fix this problem. Related Codes can be found in `fast` folder.

## Code can't compile or commented?

You might find some code won't compile, which is probably caused by some class with a same name among several different `.java` files. In this case, try to comment out all other code files except the one you are working on now. This might solve the problem. If the code is commented, just uncomment it.
